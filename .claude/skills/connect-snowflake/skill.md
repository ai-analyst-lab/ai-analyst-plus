# Skill: Connect to Live Snowflake (NovaMart)

## Purpose
Run queries against the **live Snowflake** NovaMart warehouse — not the local
DuckDB practice copy. This is the runbook for "actually go remote." Credentials
and config already exist; this skill is about *opting into remote and verifying
you landed there*.

This is distinct from `/setup-snowflake` (the first-time MCP wizard that installs
`uvx` + `snowflake-labs-mcp` and writes credentials). Use **this** skill when the
warehouse is already configured and you just want to query the live data through
`ConnectionManager`.

## When to Use
Trigger on any request to use the live/remote Snowflake data, e.g.:
- "connect to snowflake", "query snowflake", "use the live data / live warehouse"
- "run this against snowflake / the real data / production", "go remote"
- "is this hitting snowflake or duckdb?", "query the live NovaMart tables"
- Any analysis where the user explicitly wants live warehouse numbers rather than
  the local `novamart_practice.duckdb` snapshot

## How the repo decides local vs. remote
`detect_active_source()` (in `helpers/data_helpers.py`) defaults to the **local
DuckDB** copy even though the active dataset (`novamart`) declares
`connection_type: snowflake`. It only goes remote when you **opt in**, via either:
- **Env flag (per-shell):** `AAP_USE_REMOTE=1` (also accepts `true` / `yes`), OR
- **Persisted flag:** `use_remote: true` in `.knowledge/active.yaml`

`.knowledge/active.yaml` currently has `use_remote: true`, so the persistent
opt-in is already set. Still set `AAP_USE_REMOTE=1` in the same shell command as
a belt-and-suspenders guard — and to make remote intent explicit/visible.

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Run through ConnectionManager with remote opted in
`ConnectionManager` auto-loads `.env`, expands the `$SNOWFLAKE_*` placeholders
from the manifest, and lazy-connects. **The `export` must be in the same Bash
call as the `python3`** — shell env does not persist between separate tool calls.

```bash
export AAP_USE_REMOTE=1 && python3 -W ignore -c "
import warnings; warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
from helpers.connection_manager import ConnectionManager
mgr = ConnectionManager()
print('backend:', mgr.connection_type)   # MUST print 'snowflake'
df = mgr.query('SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) n FROM events GROUP BY event_type ORDER BY n DESC')
print(df.to_string(index=False))
mgr.close()
"
```

Tables are **unqualified** in the `NOVAMART` schema (e.g. `events`, `orders`,
`sessions`, `users`, `promotions`, `products`). Use Snowflake dialect:
`DATE_TRUNC('month', col)`, etc. — or `get_dialect("snowflake")` from
`helpers/sql_dialect.py`.

### Step 2 — Verify you're actually on Snowflake (not the DuckDB fallback)
Before trusting any number, confirm:
- `mgr.connection_type` returns **`snowflake`** (if it prints `duckdb`, the
  opt-in didn't take — re-check that `export AAP_USE_REMOTE=1` ran in the *same*
  command).
- A `SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT(), CURRENT_WAREHOUSE(), CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA()`
  returns **`TQ49857` / `BOOTCAMP_WH` / `BOOTCAMP_DB` / `NOVAMART`**.

Always tell the user which source is live (Rule 9).

### Step 3 — Log every query (Rule 17)
`ConnectionManager.query()` **auto-logs** at execution by default — that covers
the requirement. If you query some other way (raw connector, MCP), log manually:
```bash
python3 scripts/log_query.py --dataset novamart --agent ad-hoc \
  --purpose "..." --sql "..." --result "..."
```

## Gotchas
- `export AAP_USE_REMOTE=1` and the `python3` call **must share one Bash
  command** (`&&`), or the flag is lost and you silently get DuckDB.
- **Do not trust `sessions.had_purchase` for Nov–Dec 2024** — derive purchases
  from `events.event_type = 'purchase_complete'` or by joining `orders` on
  `session_id`. See `.knowledge/datasets/novamart/quirks.md`.
- Ignore the LibreSSL / urllib3 / NotOpenSSL warnings — harmless. Suppress with
  `-W ignore` + `warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')` as shown.
- Requires `snowflake-connector-python` (installed on this machine).
- Credentials live in `.env` (6 keys: `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT`, `SNOWFLAKE_USER`,
  `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`, `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE`, `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE`,
  `SNOWFLAKE_ROLE`). Gitignored. Never echo/cat them (Rule 16).

## To go back to local DuckDB
Unset the opt-in: `unset AAP_USE_REMOTE` for the shell, and/or set
`use_remote: false` in `.knowledge/active.yaml`. `connection_type` will then
report `duckdb`.
